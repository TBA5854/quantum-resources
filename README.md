# Quantum From Scratch

Welcome to a beginner-friendly, intuition-first guide to quantum computing using Qiskit.

## Who is this for?

This repository is for you if you:

- Can code
- Don’t mind a little math
- Feel quantum computing is always explained one abstraction too high

If you’ve ever understood the equations but still wondered  
“okay… but what is actually happening?”,  
this repo is for you.

## What is this repo trying to do?

Quantum computing is often taught in two ineffective ways:

- **Pure math:** where meaning gets lost
- **Pure code:** where magic gets hand-waved

This repo sits in the middle. The goal is to:

- Build intuition first
- Introduce math only when it earns its place
- Use Qiskit as a tool, not as the explanation

You’ll see _why_ something works before you see _how_ to code it.

## What this repo is **not**

This is **not**:

- A reference manual
- A shortcut to Shor’s algorithm
- A copy-paste cookbook

You won’t find “just trust this step” explanations here.  
Confusion is treated as a signal, not a failure.

## How to read this repo

The folders are ordered—follow them in sequence.

Each section builds exactly one new idea:

1. First concept
2. Then intuition
3. Then minimal math
4. Then Qiskit

Skipping ahead will work… until it doesn’t.

## What you’ll actually learn

By the end, you should be able to:

- Explain what a qubit is without saying “0 and 1 at the same time”
- Reason about phase, not just amplitudes
- Understand why measurement destroys information
- See what QFT is doing instead of treating it like a spell
- Read quantum circuits and predict their behavior

Not perfectly.  
But honestly.

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with:

- Basic programming concepts
- Vectors and matrices (at least intuitively)
- Complex numbers at a “this rotates stuff” level

No prior quantum knowledge is assumed.

## Philosophy

Quantum computing is strange but not mystical not black magic.  
Most confusion comes from bad metaphors and rushed explanations.

So we will:

- Move slowly
- Repeat ideas from different angles
- Prefer understanding over speed

If something feels confusing, that’s normal.  
If something feels too easy, we probably skipped a step.

## How to use this repo

Read the `.md` files first.  
Run the notebooks only after the idea makes sense.

If you get stuck, that’s part of the design.

This repo is a map written by someone who got lost—repeatedly—  
and decided to leave better signposts behind.
