# Appendix

Most quantum computing courses end when you understand the algorithms.

This repository does not.

The appendix exists to catch the things that:
- don't fit in the main flow
- trip up intermediate learners
- get hand-waved in textbooks
- cause silent failures in real code

---

## What's here

This is not reference material.  
This is **debugger wisdom**.

Every topic in this section comes from:
- a real mistake someone made
- a real confusion that kept appearing
- a real gap between theory and practice

If the main content teaches **what works**,  
the appendix explains **what breaks and why**.

## Contents

### **[Common Mistakes](./common-mistakes)**

A collection of specific errors that catch almost every beginner (and many intermediates).

These are not "gotchas" or trivia.  
They are structural failures that make circuits behave in surprising ways.

Read them to save yourself hours — or days — of debugging.

## How to use this section

You do **not** need to read this linearly.

Use it as:
- a reference when stuck
- a checklist before deploying circuits
- a reality check when simulators and hardware disagree

If something in your code feels wrong,  
there is probably a file here that explains exactly why.
