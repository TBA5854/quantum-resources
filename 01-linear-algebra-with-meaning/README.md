# Linear Algebra with Meaning

Most introductions to quantum computing start here:

> "A qubit state is represented by a vector in a 2D complex Hilbert space."

And then wonder why everyone is confused.

This section exists to build the intuition **before** the formalism.

## The problem with the usual approach

Linear algebra courses teach:
- matrices as abstract transformations
- vectors as lists of numbers
- complex numbers as reluctant additions to the curriculum

Then quantum computing arrives and says:
> "By the way, everything you learned is now physics."

No wonder it feels hostile.

## What we're doing differently

Instead of starting with math, we start with meaning:

- **Vectors** are not lists of numbers — they are **states**
- **Complex numbers** are not mathematical curiosities — they are **rotations**
- **Matrices** are not operations — they are **physical transformations**

Once you see it this way, the math stops being arbitrary.

## What you'll learn

### 1. **`vectors-as-states.md`**

You'll understand:
- why quantum states must have length 1
- why amplitudes can be negative or complex
- why measurement is projection, not observation

If you finish this and still think quantum states are "probability distributions,"  
go back and read it again.

### 2. **`complex-numbers-not-scary.md`**

You'll understand:
- why phase is invisible but essential
- why probabilities are squared magnitudes
- why interference is the whole point

Complex numbers are not decoration.  
They are the reason quantum computing works at all.

## The goal

By the end of this section, you should:
- stop seeing |ψ⟩ = a|0⟩ + b|1⟩ as algebra
- start seeing it as **geometry under constraints**

If you can do that, the rest becomes mechanical.

## One warning

If you came here looking for shortcuts or cookbook formulas,  
this section will disappoint you.

We are building foundations slowly and carefully.

That investment pays off later.
